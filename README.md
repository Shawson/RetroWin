# RetroWin

I love RetroPie (https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup), but also like Windows.  So the idea of this is a RetroPie style retro enviroment built on Windows using PowerShell.

Still very much in it's infancy, a lot of this is still being built or tested, so use at your peril.  

## Installation

Clone this to it's own folder, then open an administrator powershell and run 

    /scripts/installer.ps1

This will download and install everything you need.

Once completed start Emulation station by clicking the RetroWin icon on the Desktop!
